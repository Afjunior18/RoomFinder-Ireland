# Agile Development Process

## Epics:

**1. Platform Setup and Authentication:**

- Initial Setup and Environment Configuration.

- Allow users to register securely for an account and authenticate their credentials to access platform features.

**2.	Room Listing Creation:**

- Enable users to create and manage listings for rooms they have available for rent, including details like price, location, amenities, and photos.

- Develop validation checks to ensure accuracy of listing information.

**3.	Room Searching and Filtering:**

- Implement robust search functionality allowing users to search for available rooms based on location, price range and room type.

**4.	Messaging System between Users:**

- Develop a secure messaging system that facilitates communication between users interested in renting or listing rooms.

- Provide features for real-time messaging, notifications, and multimedia content sharing.

**5.	User Profile Management:**

- Allow users to manage their profiles, update personal information, view/edit their listings, and manage communication preferences.

- Implement options for users to delete or deactivate listings when rooms are no longer available.

**6.	Admin Panel for Content Management and User Moderation:**

- Develop an admin panel to manage user-generated content, user accounts, and platform activity.

- Provide moderation tools for admins to review, approve, or reject user-generated content and user registrations.


## Sprint

In our sprint planning session, we utilize the Fibonacci sequence to assign story points to each user story. This sequence offers a relative scale that helps us estimate the effort required for completing each task. A story point of 1 represents the simplest and quickest tasks, while higher numbers such as 8 or 13 indicate more complex and time-consuming stories. By using this scale, we can effectively prioritize and allocate resources to ensure a successful sprint delivery.

### Sprint 1:

Estimated conclusion: Starts on the 19th at 12:20 pm and ends on the 21st at 11:59 pm.

During Sprint 1, which started on February 19th at 12:20pm and concluded on February 21st at 5:50pm, I successfully completed the tasks.
Despite encountering some challenges, such as difficulties in connecting the database to Heroku and deployment issues related to static files, I managed to overcome them. To utilize the remaining time effectively, I proactively addressed future tasks, including creating the static directory with subdirectories (css, js, images) and the template directory with HTML files (currently empty but intended for future use). 

Additionally, I verified the connectivity of these directories to ensure smooth functioning.

- Set up Git repository - *(1 story points)*

- Set up Django project structure - *(3 story points)*

- Install necessary libraries and dependencies - *(3 story points)*

- Configure database settings and attach to Heroku app - *(3 story points)*

- Deploy initial application - *(3 story points)*

### Sprint 2:

Prior to commencing Sprint 2, I encountered some challenges in determining the optimal development approach, prompting me to readjust certain aspects of the planning. Over the past 10 days, my focus was on establishing the skeleton of my app, which involved creating HTML pages and connecting all functionalities. With the structure in place, I can now concentrate on the initial planning, bearing in mind that some user stories and even certain tasks from future sprints have already been completed.

For this Sprint 2, my goal is to conclude by 11:00 PM on March 6th, starting today on March 5th at 10:00 AM.
