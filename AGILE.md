# Agile Development Process

## Epics:

**1. Platform Setup and Authentication:**

- Initial Setup and Environment Configuration.

- Allow users to register securely for an account and authenticate their credentials to access platform features.

**2.	Room Listing Creation:**

- Enable users to create and manage listings for rooms they have available for rent, including details like price, location, amenities, and photos.

- Develop validation checks to ensure accuracy of listing information.

**3.	Room Searching and Filtering:**

- Implement robust search functionality allowing users to search for available rooms based on location, price range and room type.

**4.	Messaging System between Users:**

- Develop a secure messaging system that facilitates communication between users interested in renting or listing rooms.

- Provide features for real-time messaging, notifications, and multimedia content sharing.

**5.	User Profile Management:**

- Allow users to manage their profiles, update personal information, view/edit their listings, and manage communication preferences.

- Implement options for users to delete or deactivate listings when rooms are no longer available.

**6.	Admin Panel for Content Management and User Moderation:**

- Develop an admin panel to manage user-generated content, user accounts, and platform activity.

- Provide moderation tools for admins to review, approve, or reject user-generated content and user registrations.


## Sprint

In our sprint planning session, we utilize the Fibonacci sequence to assign story points to each user story. This sequence offers a relative scale that helps us estimate the effort required for completing each task. A story point of 1 represents the simplest and quickest tasks, while higher numbers such as 8 or 13 indicate more complex and time-consuming stories. By using this scale, we can effectively prioritize and allocate resources to ensure a successful sprint delivery.
